The texts are being called in by the ‘Delayer’ function to give it the Type-writer effect, 
along with the sounds.

 the game. You can quit the game anytime you like by pressing the ‘/’ button whenever 
the texts have been displayed, or any other situation.
The game stores a final score, storing your overall score, evaluating you on ethics and
